Above you can see the options available to the user. The user can choose from three different map types: Streets, Satellite and Dark. The user can also choose which data is displayed on the map: All Earthquakes, Tectonic Plates and Major Earthquakes. The user can opt to display any of this data or none at all. The images below shows some other potential viewing options for the map.
